# afkj-data-extractor
A Python-based automation tool that captures and parses game data from AFK Journey. The tool takes control of an open AFK Journey window, navigates through designated in-game menus via automated mouse movements and clicks, captures screenshots of relevant UI regions, and extracts structured data using OCR and image recognition.
